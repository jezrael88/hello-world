Hi Humans and readers!

I am writing this to mark a start of a journey - diving and committing ot this computer science course.

It starts with HarvardX: CS50

It's been a back and forth - this journey of mine.

I have enrolled over a couple times. And also, every time I ended up ghosting this course.

I was never fully committed.

However, as what I have learned from someone. Never start something which you won't complete.

So will I.

Let's see where this journey leads to.

See you,

Jez

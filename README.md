Hello Humans and Hello World!

THIS IS JEZ!

I am writing this to mark a start of a journey - diving and committing to Computer Science.

It started when I was in gradeschool. I was always fascinated with computers.

I thought someday I will be a programmer or hacker just like in movies.

But life took me on a different path.

Long story short, I still thought myself of learning to code and somehow some way I stumbled upon EDX's program "HarvardX: CS50"

It wasn't a linear path.

It's been  back and forth - this journey of mine.

I have enrolled over a couple times. And also, every time I ended up ghosting this course.

I was NEVER fully committed.

However, as what I have learned from someone, he said, "Never start something which you won't complete."

So DID comeback and hopefully and positively complete it till the end.

Let's see where this journey leads to.

See you,

Jez
